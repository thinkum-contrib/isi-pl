@deffn Function evaluate (@w{(expression @sc{object})}) : @sc{object} @sc{type-spec} @sc{boolean} 
Evaluate the expression @var{expression} and return the result.
Currently, only the evaluation of (possibly nested) commands and global
variables is supported.  The second return value indicates the actual type 
of the result (which might have been wrapped), and the third return value
indicates whether an error occurred during the evaluation.
@end deffn

@deffn Function evaluate-string (@w{(expression @sc{string})}) : @sc{object} @sc{type-spec} @sc{boolean} 
Evaluate the expression represented by @var{expression} and return the result.
This is equivalent to @code{(evaluate (unstringify expression))}.
@end deffn
