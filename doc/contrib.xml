          Added remark about PL <phrase>*.plm</phrase> file type.
          Section <xref linkend="contrib.ov"/> created, moved to external
          document subset. Using XML includes, in document source text.

        <revremark>
          Section <xref linkend="contrib.ov"/> updated after text of
          contributed <phrase>readme</phrase>. Section outline created:
          <xref linkend="contrib.ov"/>; <xref linkend="contrib.ref"/>;
          <xref linkend="contrib.xtool"/>;  <xref linkend="contrib.qa"/>.
          Primary section outline elements moved into separate
          documents. Subsequently, document revisions texts may be
          developed in each individual source document.

      implementations in Common Lisp, C++, Java and - with further
      contributed code - .. refer to PL homepage.) </remark></para>

      bibliographical references there. See also, Stanford KSL, and - at

      <para><remark>Outline - towards a practical survey of knowledge
      representation (in computing)

      Note that PL develops a manner of a KIF-like syntax,
      in PLI and - more generally - STELLA eource forms.  (TBD: Origins,
      proposed standards for KIF as approximately a category of knowledge
      representation notations sharing a common syntax and semantics. Note the
      earlier KL-ONE[KL-ONE] and ACTOR systems [Hewitt]. Note other notational
      systems in knowledge representation - IDP [DTAI]; Prolog [KSL]; DAML,
      DAML+OIL (TBD) and subsq RDF, OWL; Common Logic [RiceU]; cf. OKBC, ODM
      [OMG] (individual ODM metamodels, and ODM profiles onto the UML
      metamodel). Try to include reference to FIPA [ISO?], as may pertainin to
      any approaches for knowledge sharing across distributed systems. Note,
      then, PL SOAP (and thus, SDBC) systems.

      Referring to:

      [DTAI] https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/software/idp (NB Ans - formalisms, and articles)
      (NB MathML as a KRS notation)

      [KL-ONE] cf. articles, note the "Original KL-ONE initiative"
      pedagogically, and subsq. developments published at the CMU AI
      Repository
      http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/areas/kr/systems/kl_one/0.html

      [Hewitt] cf. "The ACTOR Paper" generally, as depicting a KRS
      notation - the paper being commonly cited, as to represent
      conceptualizations in parallel distributed systems, Note also,
      formal process algebras.

      [TBD] DAML, DAML+OIL
      [W3C] RDF, OWL

      [KSL] Prolog, Epilog, ...

        Editor's Note: This documentation has been contributed for &pl;
        in an effort to aid in further development of software systems,
        such that may be derived from &pl; or may make reference to
        &pl;. This work is not intended to replace &mdash; though it is
        hoped that it may serve to augment &mdash; the original &pl;
        manual and &pl; source code.
