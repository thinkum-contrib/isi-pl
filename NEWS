* PowerLoom 1.0.alpha (patch-level 0) released 

Remember that this is an alpha release, i.e., most likely you will encounter
bugs, inconsistencies, missing features, etc.  Main attention has been paid to
providing correct core functionality.  No run-time/space optimization has been
done so far.  Thus, if you encounter serious run-time or space performance
problems, let us know so we can fix them in future releases.
